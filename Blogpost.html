        To address the specifications outlined in Sectionabove, the application
        process must address performance, reliability, durability and
        robustness. While traditional securityprotocols cannot scale to IoE
        environments, machine learning-basedsecurity protocols succeed in these
        situations. These machine learning-basedmethods can handle large amounts
        of data andcomputing with relative ease, making them suitable for
        limited environments such as IoE. A new learning-based attack detection
        algorithm has been proposed to address various issues surrounding IoE
        security. New DL and XGBoost models are used to successfully deploy
        malware on an IoE network. Both deep neural networks and XGBoost are
        well-known models in the data science community due to their
        revolutionary work in online research and competition [6]. But these two
        standards are very different, so we use together to ensure that the new
        system can work in all situations. DL,can analyze relationships between
        features and analyze to provide efficient and accurate results. On the
        other hand, the XGBoost algorithm effectively isolates and captures
        anomalous data points using gradient boosting. The unique feature is
        that the addition of this technology can provide accurate and reliable
        detection of malware on IoE networks.

        for architectural optimization of DL models and XGBoost for negative
        node detection. In addition to previous security methods based on
        machine learning, this document also introduces a new GPSO (genetic
        particle swarm optimization) algorithm for architectural optimization of
        the DL (deep learning) model and XGBoost for IoE (Internet of
        Everything) negative node detection. wax. Architecture optimizations
        play an important role in improving the performance, reliability,
        durability and robustness of deep learning models and XGBoost.
